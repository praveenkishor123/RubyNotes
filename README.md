============

Ruby is a powerful, flexible programming language you can use in web/Internet development, to process text, to create games, and as part of the popular Ruby on Rails web framework. 

Ruby is:

High-level- meaning reading and writing Ruby is really easyâ€”it looks a lot like regular English!

Interpreted- meaning you don't need a compiler to write and run Ruby.

Object-oriented- meaning it allows users to manipulate data structures called objects in order to build and execute programs.

Easy to use- Ruby was designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto (often just called "Matz") in 1995. Matz set out to design a language that emphasized human needs over those of the computer, which is why Ruby is so easy to pick up.

Data Types: Numbers, Strings, Booleans

In Ruby, data can come in different types. There are three data types in Ruby that we're interested in right now: numbers, booleans (which can be true or false), and strings (words or phrases like "I'm learning Ruby!").

It's also important to remember that Ruby is case-sensitive (it cares about capitalization).
